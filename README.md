### My favorite vacation spot is Shimla ###

Shimla has colonial houses, market places, lakes and snow-capped mountains, making it **picturesque**. Shimla's beauty increases abundantly during the winters. Being a capital city, Shimla is well-connected by all mediums of transport. It is a good place for __adventure seekers__ and people looking for quiet time in nature's lap.
